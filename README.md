# PacMan-Lab05
This project has the game PacMan. In the classical game of PacMan, there is a maze with a hero called PacMan. The goal of the game is to eat all the dots that are on the path. Be Careful there are ghost that are wandering around and if PacMan touches them then it is game over. To win the game PacMAn has to eat all the food.
